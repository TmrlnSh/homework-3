            Jules Gabriel Verne (/vɜːrn/;[1][2] French: [ʒyl gabʁijɛl vɛʁn]; 8 February 1828 – 24 March 1905[3]) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright. His collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the Voyages extraordinaires,[3] a series of bestselling adventure novels including Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas (1870), and Around the World in Eighty Days (1872). His novels, always well documented, are generally set in the second half of the 19th century, taking into account the technological advances of the time.

In addition to his novels, he wrote numerous plays, short stories, autobiographical accounts, poetry, songs and scientific, artistic and literary studies. His work has been adapted for film and television since the beginning of cinema, as well as for comic books, theater, opera, music and video games.

            Chinghiz Aytmatov, Aytmatov also spelled Aitmatov, (born December
            12, 1928, Sheker, Kirgiziya, U.S.S.R. [now in Kyrgyzstan]—died June
            10, 2008, Nürnberg, Germany), author, translator, journalist, and
            diplomat, best known as a major figure in Kyrgyz and Russian
            literature. Aytmatov’s father was a Communist Party official
            executed during the great purges directed by Soviet leader Joseph
            Stalin in the late 1930s. Aytmatov’s literary career started in
            1952, and in 1959 he began writing for Pravda as the newspaper’s
            correspondent in Kirgiziya. He achieved major recognition with the
            collection of short stories Povesti gor i stepey (1963; Tales of the
            Mountains and Steppes), for which he was awarded the Lenin Prize in
            1963. Although Aytmatov composed in both Russian and Kyrgyz, many of
            his works, which are predominantly long short stories and novellas,
            were originally written in the latter language. Major themes in
            these works are love and friendship, the trials and heroism of
            wartime, and the emancipation of Kyrgyz youth from restrictive
            custom and tradition.

            Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle KStJ DL (22 May 1859 – 7 July 1930)
            was a British writer and physician. He created the character
            Sherlock Holmes in 1887 for A Study in Scarlet, the first of four
            novels and fifty-six short stories about Holmes and Dr. Watson. The
            Sherlock Holmes stories are milestones in the field of crime
            fiction. Doyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories, his
            works include fantasy and science fiction stories about Professor
            Challenger and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier
            Brigadier Gerard, as well as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction,
            and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short stories, "J.
            Habakuk Jephson's Statement" (1884), helped to popularise the
            mystery of the Mary Celeste.

            Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan, DBE (née Miller);
            15 September 1890 – 12 January 1976) was an English writer known for
            her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections, particularly
            those revolving around fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss
            Marple. She also wrote the world's longest-running play, the murder
            mystery The Mousetrap, which has been performed in the West End
            since 1952. A writer during the "Golden Age of Detective Fiction",
            Christie has been called the "Queen of Crime". She also wrote six
            novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. In 1971, she was made a
            Dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to
            literature. Guinness World Records lists Christie as the
            best-selling fiction writer of all time, her novels having sold more
            than two billion copies.

            William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April[b] 1564 – 23 April 1616)[c] was
            an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the
            greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest
            dramatist.[2][3][4] He is often called England's national poet and
            the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard").[5][d] His extant works,
            including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays,[e] 154 sonnets,
            three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of
            uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every
            major living language and are performed more often than those of any
            other playwright.[7] He remains arguably the most influential writer
            in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and
            reinterpreted.
